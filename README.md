UW Hydro Forecast System
========================

The University of Washington Hydrological Forecast System is a collection of tools, models, and configuration files to implement hydrological forecasts for specific areas and locations. The system forecasts hydrological characteristics such as soil moisture, snow and streamflow based on observed, modeled and forecasted meteorological conditions. Most of the data files needed for the implementation of a an actual forecast system are not included, since they are typically rather voluminous.

Implementations of the UW Hydro Forecast System serve as a **research testbed** to investigate hydrological forecasts methods and their characteristics. The system has been developed and implemented by the [Surface Water Hydrology Group](http://www.hydro.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. Visit the web site for more information. Depending on ongoing research activties, one or more functioning forecast systems may be found under the [research](http://www.hydro.washington.edu/SurfaceWaterGroup/research.php) heading on the web site. The web site also includes an extensive list of [publications](http://www.hydro.washington.edu/SurfaceWaterGroup/publications.php) by the group, including a large number dealing with forecast methods and their characteristics.

If you intend to use code from this repository for your own forecast system, please see the LICENSE.md file.
