UW Hydro Forecast System
========================
Models
------
These are the models that are used for forecasting the hydrological conditions and routing the resultant flows. In many cases these model codes will be under there own version control systems. Even so, the codes are included here as well as some of the models have undergone additional changes to make them suitable for forecasting. For example, the routing model is based on the standard VIC routing model, but has been adapted for running forecasts.
