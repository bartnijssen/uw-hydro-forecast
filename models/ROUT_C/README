%%%%% AWW-note:  as of 8/22/05, new routing still had a bug in leap year calc (as noted below)
%   also, useful modifications that could be added: 
%     input file: - either add #s to rows to help keep them in order, or
%                 - make them flag/string dependent, so order doesn't matter
%     station info functionality:  
%       - right now usage favors one fract, direc, uh, etc file for all stns
%          (using the station location file as is)
%       - could have OPTION:  if for stnloc file "FILE" is entered, the stnloc
%         file is read with all input options (except for date) for each different 
%         location; else location info is supplied in input file 
%           (i.e., routing is just for one location). 
% 
%     lastly, functionality needed for forecasting:  specify prefluxes directory
%             and dates needed for prefluxes

rout_similar_to_f_version:
Should be the 'same' model as the f-version.
(At leas I get the similar results).

Comparison to the fortran-version of the code:
Changes 1: The master routing file has to be similar to the one in 
  this directory. I.e. list the input files in the same order, and keep 
  the structure as is.
Changes 2: A column is added to the station information file. The second
  number on the line gives information on whether the station 
  is already routed (1). If so, it won't be routed again. 
  If you set the number to 0, the routing
  program assumes you want to rout the area again. 
  NB! NB! NB!
	You should list the stations from upstream to downstream locations!
  NB! NB! NB!   
        Be aware that this causes changes to the .uh_s file!!!!!
Changes 3: For each routed station, a file called 'fluxes_lat_lon_routed' is made.
  It will be located in the 'Output_files' directory. Units m3/s.
Changes 4: The output is written to m3/s instead of ft3/s. :). 

New feature 1: Skips days in VIC simulation files that won't be routed.
  i.e. ndays is number of days to be routed, not number of days to 
  be routed + number of simulation days before routing starts, which it used to be.
  NB! This may result in less runoff at the beginning of the routing period!!!!
New feature 2: Areas already routed won't be routed again. I.e. if an upstream 
  station location has been routed during this run, or previously (see 'changes 2').

Stupid 1: If you want to do the routing at a location upstream other gauges, 
 you have to make sure the 'Already routed' column is set to 0 at the downstream 
 location........ 
Stupid 2: The VIC simulation flux files have to be ascii files with the 
 following columns:
 Year Month Day Dummy Dummy Runoff Baseflow
Improvements will be implemented in the future some time!
