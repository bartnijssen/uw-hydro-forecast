Subject: Re: routing (fwd)


Hi there!

The routing models (one which should be similar to the f version and one 
which gives similar results but is slighlty different) can be found in
~ingjerd/models/rout/rout_c_2004/  (i am ssuming you still have access to 
the hydro computers, Bart). I actually wrote a readme file about two years 
ago, but who knows how useful it is.

rout_new.c is out of date - but the version i am working on at the moment 
I don't trust yet (the way it handles reservoirs).
