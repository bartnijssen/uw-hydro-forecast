BUILDING

The requirements to compile and run spi are:

o  An ANSI standard C compiler.  GNU gcc version 2.3.3 running under Linux
   was used for developement, but the code is generic enough that it should
   compile easily with any ANSI compiler.  If you are forced to use a K&R
   compiler, you will have modify the function headers and remove the function
   prototypes.

o  An operating system that supports unix-like I/O redirection.  Other
   operating system may be used, but will require some code
   modifications.

o  Sufficient memory to support the program and data arrays.

o  A math library that provides lgamma(), the log gamma function.
   (On some systems lgamma may be named gamma.)

Unix systems:

1) Edit Makefile to suit your system.

2) Type 'make'.

Other systems:

1) Compile spi.c, rd_prec.c and spi_gamma.c (or spi_empiric.c).
   
2) Link the resulting object modules with the appropriate math library.

If you have trouble running spi because your system does not have enough
memory, you may want to edit spi.h and change the lines:

#define BEGYR  1850
#define ENDYR  2000

to specify a shorter period of record.


RUNNING

The spi program is implemented as a unix-style filter; i.e. it reads
from standard input (stdin) and write to standard output (stdout).
Thus it is easy to use with a variety of input data and output
processing without rewriting the SPI generating program.  All that
needs to be done is to write apropriate 'frontend' and 'backend'
filter.  For example, if several data streams are to be analyzed and
each has a different format, we need only to write a filter that reads
each format and outputs the format spi expects.  Similarly, we may
have several filters that plot time series or perform statistical
analysis on the resulting index values.

Spi also requires specifying one or more time scale parameters.  Simply
add these to the command line.  For example:

	spi 3 6 12 <infile.dat >outfile.dat

Input and Filters 

Input to the spi program consists of a file for each station.  The
file contains a single head line; this line may contain any character
data; e.g. station number, latitude, longitude, etc.  The header is
passed as-is to stdout.  Following the header are a the data records;
each data record has 3 blank separarted fields:

	yyyy mm prec

        Where:
            yyyy - year; values > ENDYR and < BEGYR will be skipped.
            mm   - month [1-12]
            prec - precipitation (in 0.01's of inches)

        Special codes:
            -9900 = Missing


Two input filters have been included with the spi package as examples.
One, mon_filter, translates files in the Colarado Climate monthly data
format (.mon).  The other, ghcn_filter, reads data files extracted
from the Global Historic Climate Network.  Examples of these formats
appear in the data subdirectory.

Calibration Period

By default the probability function is calculated for the entire
period of record.  It is also possible to specify the period of time
for which the probability distribution is calculated.  This is useful
for datasets that don't have identical period of records.  The
switches -bc and -ec specify the beginning and end of the calibration
period; e.g.

	spi -bc 1961 -ec 1990 12 <denver.dat

will use the 1961-1990 period for computing the distribution.  SPI
values will still be claculated for al the input data.

Usage Examples

1) List 12 month time scale values for data in denver.dat:

	spi 12 <denver.dat

  Note: Output from this example is in data/denver.spi.

2) Display spi index for time scale 3, 6 and 12 months using
   data in the file 53005.mon.  The file is is '.mon' format.
   Send the results to the file 53005.spi:

	mon_filter <53005.mon | spi 3 6 12 >53005.spi

3) Display current index values for all '.mon' format files in
   ./data.  This is a unix shell script:

#--begin script--
#!/bin/sh

for i in ./data/*.mon; do
  echo $i
  mon_filter <$i | spi 12 24 36 | tail -1
done

#--end script--



FORTRAN NOTES

A Fortran version, spi.f, has been provided for those without C
capability.  

- It works the same as the C version with the exception
that the time scale values are fixed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.
To change the number of time scales and/or their values:

	1) Edit the 'parameter' statment in the main program.
	Change 'nlen=4' to reflect the number of time scales
	you want.

	2) Edit the 'data len /...' statement to contain the
	time scales you want.

	3) Recompile.

- The provided Makefile creates the executable spi_f.

- The program as written uses the f77 default I/O unit numbers; i.e.
  0=stderr, 5=stdin and 6=stdout.  These may easily be changed by
  using explicit 'open' statments.

- Every effort has been to be ANSI compliant.  The most notable
  exception is the use of lower case.

- The function 'gammln' has been provided since many Fortran
  libraries lack a log-gamma function.

- The output of the spi.f version should be nearly identical to that 
  of spi.c.  Noted exceptions are:
	
	1) The header line is padded with blanks to 80 characters.
	2) Fortran sometimes writes -0.00 where C writes 0.00.
	3) There are occaisional small differences (usually 0.01)
           due to differences in precision (spi.f is single precision;
	   spi.c id double precision) and different log-gamma functions.

- There is an Fortran example input filter, ghcn_filter.f.
